# Proxy

Same interface, different behavior inside

Any Proxy on to of original object in order to add more functionality

## Proxy versus Decorator

Proxy : identical interface, it doesn't have to aggregate or reference the target object
maybe with object not event materialized
Decorator : enhanced interface, it aggregates or references the target object
